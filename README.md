# interfacing-keypad-and-LCD-with-8051
> We aim to use Atmega 8052 microcontroller to create a simple calculator, by entering numbers and symbols in 4*4 keypad, and watching the results being displayed on 16×2 lcd.
Project function is simple when anyone presses the button on keypad the character associated with that button will be displayed on the screen of 16×2 lcd, and when press the character “=”, the result of the arithmetic operation will be displayed on the screen too.

### Components and the usage of each one:

•	16×2 lcd   to display the outputs.

•	4×4, numeric keypad to enter the input.

•	8051(89c52) Microcontroller 

•	Power supply (5 volts) to provide power to lcd.

•	Crystal Oscillator (12 MHz) responsible for supplying the clock signals in microcontroller.

•	Bread board (To build circuit)

•	Potentiometer (Variable Resistor) To adjust Lcd contrast.

•	2 capacitors (22 pF) to be connected with crystal, used to oscillate it.

•	10 K ohm Resistor and 10 uF capacitor, used to create standard reset circuitry (connected to Pin 9 (RST) is the reset PIN).

### circuit connections
we connected Port-1 of 89c52 microcontroller to our 4×4 keypad data pins(P1.0-P1.7). 

where rows of 4×4 keypad connected to Port-1 pins5,6,7,8 Connect columns of it to Port-1 pins 0,1,2,4.

Then we connected Port-2 pins of 89c52 microcontroller to our 16×2 lcd data pins(D0-D7). 

We connected:

 enable pin of lcd with Port-3 to the third pin. 
 
 RS(register select) pin of lcd with Port-3 pin 5. 
 
 RW(read-write)pin of lcd to 8051 Port-3 pin 4. 
 
 Connect Rest of the connections are manual which we do in our all circuits. 
 
 Ground Pin 20. 

 
 Apply 5 volts to pin 31 and VDD pin in Lcd. 
 
Connect Oscillator with pin#19(XTAL-1) and 18(XTAL-2) of 8051 in parallel to two 22 pF capacitors. 

reset button with pin#9(reset) of 89c52 microcontroller with 10 Kohm Resistor and 10 uF capacitor.
